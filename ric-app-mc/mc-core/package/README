This directory contains "package" level scripts which are needed either
for building the MC image, or are needed when starting or stopping
the image in a container. These are not really a part of the xAPP.


encode_json.py	-- reads a json file and generates the quoted output
	suitable for passing on a curl command etc.

j2src.py  -- parses the config file (descriptor file) to extract info
	needed at the time the start script is run.

xam_register.sh -- sends a register or unregister request to the xAPP
	manager process.


These scripts should all be copied to /playpen/bin in the image.
