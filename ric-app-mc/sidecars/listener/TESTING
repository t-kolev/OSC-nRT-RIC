Quick test
Build the container, and run the test:
	# the container version number may be different than illustrated here
	bash build_images.sh
	docker run -it --rm mc_listener:1.2.1 bash /playpen/bin/verify.sh -l



Indepth Testing Details
The verify.sh script can be used to verify that the mc_listener binary
in the container is working.  The script will create a sending process
that will send messages to the listener.  It will also create a pipe
reader process for each FIFO that is expected to be created by the 
listener.  

The default test
	bash /playpen/bin/verify.sh

The default is a short, approximately 15 second, test which
will generate all of the FIFOs, and a single raw data capture file
in the staging directory.  The test isn't long enough for the raw
data capture mechanism to attempt to "roll" the capture file.

The long test
	bash /playpen/bin/verify.sh -l

The long test runs for approximately 150 seconds and sets the roll
frequency on the capture files to 13 seconds.  This test should
generate several files in the "final" directory. One, in progress,
file should be left in the staging directory.

Copy vs Rename
By default the raw data capture will attempt to rename the file to
move it from staging to final. However, if these directories are not
on the same filesystem the rename will fail.  In this case, the rdc
code will copy the file.  These two mechanisms can be tested by
supplying the container with an external volume, /data, which contains
a final directory.  For example:

	mkdir -p /tmp/rdc/final
	docker run -v /tmp/rdc:/data --rm -it mc_listener:1.2.0 bash /playpen/bin/verify.sh -l

When the verify script sees /data/final it will set that as the directory
for the finished files rather than using the default which is on the
same filesystem as the staging directory.  The staging directory can
be changed to be an external directory by adding ./stage to the volume
which is mounted. For example

	mkdir -p /tmp/rdc/stage

The verify script will find this and switch away from the default and
allow a test with both directories to originate from outside of the
container.

The following is sample output from running the long test:
