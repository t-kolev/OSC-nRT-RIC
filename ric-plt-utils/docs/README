This directory is a common area where all utilty documentation is
placed to be scraped and pushed to a publication spot. Each document
in this directory is expected to have a unique filename prefix (e.g.
mgxapp_ for the metrics gateway xAPP) to avoid duplications for the
common names such as user_guide.rst.

Exceptions to this are the obvious common files such as the overall
document index.
