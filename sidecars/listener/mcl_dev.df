#	Mnemonic:	mcl_dev.df
#	Abstract:	This is a docker build file which creates an image that can be used
#				for interactive development of the MC listener and related applications.
#				Building should be as simple as:
#					docker build -f mcl_dev.df -t mcl_dev:latest .
#
#				The image contains the NNG and RMR libraries and headers needed.  The 
#				MC listener source is NOT placed into the image. Rather the source should
#				be mounted as a volume when the container is created:
#
#					docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/playpen/src -u <uid>:<gid> sh
#				(assuming that the source is in the current working directory).
#				Once the container is running, vi, make and git are all available.
