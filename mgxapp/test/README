This directory contains all of the tests which can be run
to vet the modules for the MG xAPP.

Run the script unit_test.sh (ksh or bash) to build and execute
each test. The script will leave the relivent .gcov files
in the directory for any additional use. It will also provide
a high level summary of the coverage of each of the modules.

The data directory contians input files which are used during
the tests.


The test programmes are all named *_test.cpp. There are support
tools also located in this directory:

	ut_support.cpp  -- test tools used by all test programmes
	parse_gcov.sh  -- script to parse .gcov files for summary
	stats_sender.c -- A simple xAPP which sends RMR messages with
					the metrics message type.

It is possible to drive the unit tests from the top level CMake
generated build environment:

	mkdir .build
	cd .build
	cmake ..
	make test ARGS="-V"
