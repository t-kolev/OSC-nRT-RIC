# this file should contain ONLY a brief explaination of each change
# pushed into the repo. Date, version and Jira issue ID should be
# mentioned.  This file will be scraped to generate the RTD release
# notes file, so format dictates that each change start with a
# "year Month day" string. Please do NOT use rst text here!


# This file is parsed by a document builder and the rel-notes.rst
# file for the RTD site is generated. Changes must start with a date
# and version string. Blank lines are used to separate items when a version
# has several changes.  Multiple blank lines between versions are squished
# to one.
