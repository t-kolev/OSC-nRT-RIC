RIC VESPA manager
=================

The VESPA manager uses the VES Agent [https://github.com/nokia/ONAP-VESPA](https://github.com/nokia/ONAP-VESPA)
to adapt near-RT RIC internal statistics' collection using Prometheus
(xApps and platform containers) to ONAP's VES (VNF event streaming).

The vesmgr container runs two processes: the VESPA manager and the VES
Agent (i.s. VESPA).

The VESPA manager starts and configures the VES Agent.

The VES Agent is a service acting as a bridge between Prometheus and
ONAP's VES Collector.

# Application metrics definition

The application metrics are defined in the application descriptor.
For each counter, the following fields are required in the "metrics"
section of the descriptor:

* name - Prometheus name of the counter
* objectName - object name in VES
* objectInstance - object instance in VE

The VESPA manager receives the application metrics configuration from the
application manager. It subscribes the app notification messages from the
application manager, and after having received one, requests the latest
application configuration, creates the VES Agent configuration based on it,
and restarts the VES Agent.

The VES Agent does not report any other metrics to VES.

# Prometheus configuration

The VES Agent reads the ricComponentName from Prometheus label
"kubernetes_name".

# VES Collector event format

The VES Agent transmits events to the VES Collector in the
VES Common Event Format v5.4.1.
The Common Event Format is expressed in JSON schema v28.4.1.

# Liveness probe

The VESPA manager replies to liveness HTTP GET at path /supervision.

# Errors

The VESPA manager exits in the following error cases:

* The VES Agent exits
* An unrecoverable system error during the initialization, for example
  * Creation of the VES Agent configuration file fails
  * Creation of a HTTP request message fails

# Unit Tests

In order to run the VESPA manager unit tests, give the following command:

```shell
go test ./... -v
```
