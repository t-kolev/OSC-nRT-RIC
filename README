This repo contains source and documentation for the Management Campaign (MC) xAPP.

The following is a list of important directories at the root level of
the repo and a brief description of each.

mc-core
This is the source for the core MC application

sidecars
The MC application currently uses at least one "sidecar" container to
listen for messages and to funnel them in. This directory contains
one subdirectory per sidecar application.

ci
This is the continuous integration directory. Within the ci directory
are subdirectories for each docker image which is created to support
the application.

docs
Project documentation in a form which can be scraped from the repo and pushed
to a "free standing" document hosting site.
